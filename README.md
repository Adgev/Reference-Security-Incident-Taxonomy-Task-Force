# Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force
Following a discussion amongst the CSIRT community during the ‘51st TF-CSIRT meeting’  (15 May 2017 in The Hague, Netherlands), it was concluded that there is an urgent need for a taxonomy list and name that serves as a fixed reference for everyone. This is why ENISA and TF-CSIRT created the ‘Reference Security Incident Taxonomy Task force".  The aim of this task force is to enable the CSIRT community in reaching a consensus on a reference taxonomy. 

To become part of the task force, the requester should send an email to ENISA secretariat  CSIRT-Relations@enisa.europa.eu or sign up for a physical meeting during a TF-CSIRT event. In case of physical meeting, please notify in presence to the ENISA secretariat or via email the request for addition to the mailing list.

You may suggest additions to the taxonomy via github's [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) mechanism. These pull requests will be discussed at the next TF-CSIRT event and merged - provided they achieve group consensus. See also the [Documentation/ToR.md](Terms of Reference).

During the 2nd meeting at 53rd TF-CSIRT in Hamburg it was decided to use eCSIRT.net as starting point and use as it is for version 1.
